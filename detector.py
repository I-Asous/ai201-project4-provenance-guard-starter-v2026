Signal one: the model signal.

This is the signal that "reads the text for meaning". It runs a language model
on your own machine and asks one question: **how predictable is this text?**

The idea is the one every AI-detection product is built on. A language model
writes by repeatedly picking a likely next word, so text a model produced tends
to be text a model finds easy to predict. Human writing wanders more — odd word
choices, abrupt turns, the specific rather than the typical.

The measure is called **perplexity**. Low perplexity means "I could have
guessed this"; high perplexity means "that surprised me". This module turns
that into a 0–1 score where **higher means more likely AI**.

    from detector import model_signal
    score = model_signal("some text")     # 0.0 human-ish … 1.0 AI-ish

Everything runs locally. No account, no key, no card.

⚠️ **The blind spot, which you have to name in Milestone 1.**

Predictability is not the same thing as authorship. What this signal actually
rewards is **common words in short, ordinary sentences** — and plenty of real
people write that way.

Someone writing in a second language, sticking to vocabulary they're sure of.
A younger writer. Anyone writing plainly on purpose. Measured against gpt2,
writing like that scores about as machine-like as machine writing does.

The reverse trips people up too: dense, ornate prose full of rare words often
scores as *human* on this signal, because rare words are exactly what a
language model fails to predict. Formality on its own doesn't decide it.

So the writers this signal is most likely to accuse are the ones with the
least room to argue back. That is structural rather than a bug you can fix,
and it is the person Milestone 1 asks you to follow through your service.

Don't take that on trust — it's a claim you can check. Milestone 4 has you run
four calibration inputs. Add a plainly-written human paragraph to them and see
for yourself where it lands.
